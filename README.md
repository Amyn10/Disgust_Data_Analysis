#My secondary data analysis on how Religosity influences Disgust Sensitivity Levels

These files include Berker and Anaki Disgust Scale in R format
R format is important as SPSS not compatible with code
Project Code is my final code including statistical analysis such as SEM and Bayesian Regression Analysis 
Other two files include the orginal DS_R Questions in Hebrew and my translation
